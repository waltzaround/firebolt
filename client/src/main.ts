/**
 * Vibe Coding Starter Pack: 3D Multiplayer - main.ts
 * 
 * This is a minimal entry point file for TypeScript initialization.
 * The actual application entry point is in main.tsx which renders the React app.
 * 
 * This file can be used for:
 * - Global TypeScript initialization
 * - Pre-React setup that needs to happen before the app mounts
 * - Setting up global variables or polyfills
 * 
 * Note: In the current setup, this file only logs a message and the primary
 * functionality is in App.tsx which is rendered via main.tsx.
